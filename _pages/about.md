Hi! I'm Harry and I'm currently on sabbatical working on projects, online courses and exploring my hobbies and interests.

- I'm interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence and full-stack software engineering.
- I enjoy building ML systems and extracting insights from data.
- I'm a proficient Python programmer with over 8 years of experience.
- I have previously worked for 2 years as a Data Scientist at [Yordas Digital](https://www.yordasgroup.com/){:target="_blank"}.
- I studied BSc Computer Science (First Class) and MSc Data Science (Distinction) at Lancaster University.
- During my second year at Lancaster University in 2018 I created and sold a [full-stack time management application](https://www.ca-tms.com/){:target="_blank"} to a large architecture firm as a side project. It is currently being used by over 60 employees on a daily basis.
- I'm obsessed with productivity.
- I like keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in AI research.

## Productivity ‚úèÔ∏è

I'm obsessed with productivity and being organised. Having tried every productivity app under the sun, I've finally settled on the following setup:

- Notion (for my second brain, I follow [Tiago Forte's PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/){:target="_blank"})
- Todoist (for daily tasks, habits and miscellaneous todos)
- Fantastical (for planning events and runs)
- Readwise (for automatically syncing tweets and highlights to Notion)
- Instapaper (for quickly saving online content to read later)
- GoodNotes (for taking hand-written notes on iPad)
- Grammarly (for spell-checking and general language checks for blog posts)

## Running üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My current gear is the following:

- Garmin Forerunner 255 (for recording runs)
- Garmin Running Dynamics Pod (for advanced data tracking during runs)
- Apple Watch Series 8 (yes, I do wear 2 watches!)
- AirPods Pro 1st Gen (for music)
- Asics Novablast 3 (for training runs)
- Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 (for races and parkruns)
- Hoposo Massage Gun (for recovery and pre-workout)

I create custom workouts for all my runs on a Sunday for the following week using the calendar in Garmin Connect. The runs can then be synced to the Garmin Forerunner to make starting preset workouts much faster. I record treadmill and outdoor runs on the Garmin which, once saved, upload activity data to Garmin Connect and Strava automatically.

My fuelling and post-workout nutrition is the following:

- Maurten Gel 100 CAF 100 and Drink Mix 160 (for energy boosts and to keep me hydrated)
- SIS Go Hydro Electrolyte Tablets (for hydration and recovery)
- Veloforte energy chews and recovery shakes (for energy boosts and post-workout recovery)
- MyProtein pre-workout and energy gels (alternate between these and Maurten gels)
- MyProtein electrolyte supplements (to replace lost electrolytes)
- MyProtein protein powder (for a post-workout shake)

I do parkrun most weekends depending on my training routine. Follow me on Strava if you're into running!

## Others üë®üèª‚Äçüíº

- I believe in simplicity and elegance. Websites, applications and AI algorithms can be over-engineered sometimes (inspiration taken from [here](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/){:target="_blank"}).
- I like building things from scratch so I understand the tools I use.
- I like to spend time mastering the fundamentals to make life easier further down the line with the more advanced material.
- Work hard, play hard!
