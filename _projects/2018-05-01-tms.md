## Introduction

During my internship as an Accounts Assistant for an architecture firm in 2017, I was responsible for managing employee timesheets. These paper-based timesheets were given to the accounts department by hand, each week, and were entered into an Excel document manually. I very quickly realised that there must be a more efficient solution for managing these timesheets and given I was learning web technologies at the time I couldn't help but discuss this with the company. They were very keen on the idea of giving me the opportunity to develop a new timesheet system and subsequently I began designing a prototype.

The company had informed me of their interest to introduce a time management application, although due to the significant development time and programming expertise a system like this would require, a third-party solution became the only realy viable option. There are a wide range of different solutions available online and after the company's extensive research into the options available, the price point to introduce this system would cost in the region of £20,000 to £40,000 depending on any additional add-ons they may want to choose. However a significant portion was training costs for employees to be taught how to use the system.

This was an interesting point for me because from my computing background I've been taught about user-centered design and designing applications to be easy to use. I felt if a system required expensive training costs then the system can't be easy to use. Granted these prebuilt solutions may contain several features that may need some guidance on how to use, however for simple time entry it should be more or less intuitive. I personally believe new users of a system should pick up how to use it as soon as they begin using it.

The company was ideally looking for a bespoke software solution tailored to the company's requirements, in which they could export all entered data as CSV files should they become disatisfied with the system or want to upgrade to a new system. Many solutions did not have this feature however and became one of the key benefits of developing an in-house solution.

## The Current System

Staff complete timesheets on a weekly basis. There are two components to a weekly timesheet - time and expenses. Time includes all the jobs an employee has worked on during the week (assigned by their time leader) and any non-chargeable time, such as holidays or hospital appointments. Expenses for jobs they worked on must also be recorded, which includes recording mileage and general expenses such as parking or train tickets where appropriate. Each job is assigned a unique number and description, alongside other details such as the client, address and postcode, with these additional details belonging in a spreadsheet managed by the accounts department. Any expenses are also recorded on the back of the timesheet, such as parking tickets, train tickets and any other general expenses.

All time records are managed by the accounts department and stored in several Excel spreadsheets. Despite Excel having many advantages, such as support for powerful processing such as Pivot Tables, they have many shortcomings such as a lack of data validation, data inconsistency and data duplication. This ultimately leads to a variety of problems.

Some of the disadvantages of the current system are as follows:

- Manual data entry: a member of staff in the accounts department must constantly input employee timesheets, from paper, into an Excel document - not only is this a laborious task, but distracts from more important business work

- Data duplication: timesheets could potentially be entered twice accidentally

- Data inconsistency: everyone is different; people may have their own interpretation of a job description, meaning 2 different employee's timesheets for the same job could have slightly different descriptions resulting in confusion for the member of staff inputting this to the spreadsheet

- Size: Excel only supports a maximum of 1 million rows

- Speed: with a large number of rows, a spreadsheet may become slow

- Difficult to collaborate: 2 users editing simultaneously may overwrite each others changes

- Lack of validation

## The Proposed System

My initial idea was to create a single full-stack web application with an easy-to-use web interface to facilitate the entry and management of employee timesheets. This would enable access from a laptop/desktop computer with an internet connection anywhere in the world.

A particularly desirable advantage of developing a new system would mean timesheet data is centralised, accessible via an easy-to-use web user interface anywhere with an internet connection.

The system would not only facilitate time entry for staff, but would enable admins to easily analyse staff performance and notice which employees are behind on their timesheets.

The application should be optimised for desktop computers - given that staff have become accustomed to completing paper timesheets, the need for screen space to display the whole timesheet was paramount. A mobile application was discussed, however staff preferred using desktop computers and laptops to complete timesheets due to the larger screen space.

The application has been designed to be scalable, meaning should a feature such as expenses analysis become desirable, it is straightforward to implement queries to access data from the existing database.

## System Architecture

Below is a diagram outlining the full system architecture:

</div>

- Client Application: written in React.js, using Redux for state management and Ant Design for the user interface
- Server Application: an API written in Node.js with the Express.js framework to connect the front-end client application to the database
- Database: a PostgreSQL database to store the company data

I decided to use React.js for the front-end as I was learning it at the time and was very fun to develop applications with. <a href="https://ant.design/">Ant Design</a> components was used for the general structure of the application. Express.js with Node.js was used to write the server application, and would talk to a PostgreSQL database to store company data. I also took the decision to use Firebase Authentication as dealing with emails and passwords manually can very easily go wrong.

A typical employee will work on several jobs per week. Clicking the job title cell will make the cell editable. The user can begin typing either the job number or the job description and jobs will be filtered accordingly using an autocomplete algorithm. Job numbers with a red background indicate a fee for this job hasn't been entered yet, with green indicating a fee is present. Selecting a job will add it to the timesheet. The employee must then add a stage for this job (i.e. which stage of the job they worked on, e.g. Concept, On Site, Bid etc). Then they can add the number of hours for each day they worked on the job during the week, with an ability to add an optional comment for each row of the timesheet. If the employee was absent from work (e.g. a dentist appointment, holiday, compassionate leave etc) they can complete the stage/code field with the relevent code and fill in the hours they were absent.

An employee can submit their timesheet once completed and will advance to the next week ready for next week's work. An employee can optionally save a timesheet if they wish to save their changes temporarily and complete their timesheet at a later point in time.

## Implementation

After significant refinements and further developments of the originally demonstrated prototype, the current version of the system to date looks like this:

![Employee Dashboard](dashboard.png)

Once signed in, each employee is presented with a personalised dashboard including details of how many weeks behind they are on timesheets, their recent jobs, and the timesheet entry form. Once data is entered to the timesheet, it can be saved by clicking on 'Save', and submitted by clicking on 'Submit Timesheet'. The latter will permanently store timesheet submissions in a single database, and can be viewed by admins on the admin dashboard. All directors can view how many weeks behind staff members are in a single table:

Time records and expenses can also be exported separately as CSV files for convenience. Below is an example of a submitted timesheet accessed through the admin dashboard:

## Challenges

During development of this project I faced many difficult challenges:

- Authorisation rules: determining who has access to which areas of the application using pre-defined access rules

- Restoring timesheets on the admin side: despite sounding like a simple thing to do once submitted, each row of a timesheet is broken down into days that jobs were completed, so someone who works on a job every day for 5 days would produce 5 separate rows - this was for just one row of the timesheet

- Steep learning curve: creating a full-stack application from scratch was not easy, but was a very rewarding experience to work on a real-world project whilst learning new technologies

- Many CSS issues: anyone who has worked with CSS knows it can be a real pain to get things working

- Complex application state management: I used Redux for the state management, and despite being incredibly useful once set up, it was quite difficult to set up with a lot of boilerplate code

- Deployment options: lots of options were available for deployment with different cloud hosting platforms, all with different prices, pros and cons

## Conclusion

I believe overall the project has been a great success. Extensive feedback from employees has enabled a more thorough system to be developed and bugs to be identified and dealt with. The migration from the existing system to the new system wasn't a particularly smooth transition, however this was expected.

The application is still actively maintained by myself when necessary, although it can run autonomously without my intervention.

I'd like to thank David Parkinson (the practice manager) and the directors for giving me the oppurtunity to develop the system during my time at university. I have learned an invaluable amount of business knowledge during my time and I look forward to further developing the system in the near future.
